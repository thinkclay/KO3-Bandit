I'm in the process of moving around many functions and methods that I've used and collected over the years doing web scrapes. I make no claims and take no responsibility for what YOU do with this module, but the following are some of the various uses that I have implemented the module for:

* Parsing raw web data
* Extracting and watermarking images from one site to a local copy
* Text, feed, and raw file parsing with support for mime detection
* Circumventing captchas, obfuscation, and session/cookie validation

With this module alone, you can create any number of usefull applications from search engines and web crawlers to spamming or automation tools (not that I recommend doing so, but if you so desire, the functionality is there).
